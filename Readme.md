### *Cold Start :* 
I am using free service of render of after a period of inactivity render automatically spin down to conserve resources so the first request after a period of inactivity can take significantly longer, often 50 seconds or more, as the instance has to "wake up."
To handle this problem i am using a *Keep Alive Server Technique* using UptimeRobot
